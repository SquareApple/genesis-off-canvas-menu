GENESIS OFF-CANVAS MENU
=======================

Inspired by the demo at [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/09/16/off-canvas-menu-effects/) and adapted to work with Genesis.

Use at your own discretion in the wild. The original was only developed with the latest browsers in mind, and I've only added small changes to make the potential use on a live site closer to reality.
